### README CLAARITY CHEST X-RAY PNEUMONIA DIAGNOSIS DETECTOR 

#### Project Overview:
This project utilizes machine learning to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. It includes two main components: a pneumonia classification model and an X-ray detector model. The application allows for predicting pneumonia

#### Features:
- **Choose patient ID**: select patient ID to determine pneumonia of patient x-ray
- **Prediction**: The application uses a trained model to predict whether an uploaded image is an X-ray. If it is, it further predicts whether pneumonia is present.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit, the interface provides a seamless experience for users to interact with the prediction models.

#### Usage:
- Upload a chest X-ray image using the file uploader.
- Wait for the prediction results to appear.
- If the image is classified as an X-ray, the app will predict whether pneumonia is present.

#### Contributions:
Contributions to improve the models or enhance the application's features are welcome! Please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
